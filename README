mogilefs-ftpd
=============

This is a FTP daemon based on nanoftpd written in PHP. It has a MogileFS
backend that uses the MogileFS PECL extension.

Basic upload, download, deletion is possible but not all FTP commands can be
translated to MogileFS command (eg. chmod).

The original nanoftpd version has been modified to be multi process capable
and some unmaintained code has been removed.

This is production safe quality software and we used it several month while
migrating to MogileFS.

Installation
============
You need at least PHP 5.2.6 and these PHP extensions to run mogilefs-ftpd:

* sockets
* pcntl
* PECL MogileFS (https://pecl.php.net/mogilefs)
* PECL proctitle (optional)

There is a logrotate config and a init script available in the contrib
directory.

Hints
=====
1. io_file and the database authentication modules are not tested by me and I
don't know if they work.

2. I use the ftp daemon with the text database authentication which also
supports using custom IO modules for any user.

3. path convention is <mogilefs class>/<filename>. If your MogileFS is not
using this convention you can still use this module but you may have to 
adjust io_mogilfs.php.

4. PHP error logs go to log/nanoftpd.err. Application logs go to
log/nanoftpd.log

5. password for the shipped test user in users text database is 'test'.

6. when listing files in classes there is a limit for the list.  If you have 
a large MogileFS class it doesn't really makes sense to list millions of 
files (tough it is possible if you adjust the listlimit).

7. MKD command can create MogileFS classes and RMD can delete them. 

8. you can even rename files in MogileFS using the RNFR RNTO commands.

Configuration
=============
adjust values in config.php and start the deamon. 

mogilefs->listlimit = 1000;
limit of the list returned by LIST command. Set as low as possible for best
performance. :)

mogilefs->extendedlist = true;
this will enable meta data lookup for every file in the LIST output. If you
don't need the file length in the output, let this off to avoid lookups and
speed up listing.

mogilefs->searchlist = true;
allow you to search mogilefs files via LIST <search prefix>. So LIST test will
search for any files matching <class>/test*.

mogilefs->canrename = true;	
allow rename commands to be translated into MogileFS commands. 

mogilefs->canmkdir = true;
on mkdir command create a MogileFS class with the given directory name.

mogielfs->canrmdir = true;
on rmdir command delete a MogileFS class with the given directory name. 

mogilefs->mindevcount = 2;
mindevcount parameter for creating MogileFS classes.

Compatibility
=============
Used to work with:
* PHP FTP extension of PHP 5.2.6 
* FileZilla on Ubuntu
* Cyberduck Version 4.0.2 (8601) on MacOS X
