mogilefs-ftpd
=============

This is a FTP daemon based on nanoftpd written in PHP. It has a MogileFS
backend that uses the MogileFS PECL extension.

Basic upload, download, deletion is possible but not any FTP command can be
mapped to MogileFS command (eg. chmod).

The original nanoftpd version has been modified to be multi process capable
and some unmaintained code has been removed.

This is production safe quality software and we used it several month while
migrating to MogileFS.

Installation
============
You need at least PHP 5.2.6 and these PHP extensions to run mogilefs-ftpd:
 
* sockets
* pcntl
* PECL MogileFS (http://projects.usrportage.de/index.fcgi/php-mogilefs)
* PECL proctitle (optional)

There is a logrotate config and a init script available in the contrib
directory.

Hints
=====
1. io_file and the database authentication modules are not tested by me and I
don't know if they work.

2. i use the ftp daemon with the text database authentication which also
supports using custom IO modules for any user. 

3. path convention is <mogilefs class>/<filename>. If your mogilefs is not
using this convention you can still use this module but the listing feature
won't work.

4. PHP error logs go to log/nanoftpd.err. Application logs go to
log/nanoftpd.log

5. password for the shipped test user in users text database is 'test'.
