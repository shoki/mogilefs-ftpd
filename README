mogilefs-ftpd
=============

This is a FTP daemon based on nanoftpd written in PHP. It has a MogileFS
backend that uses the MogileFS PECL extension.

Basic upload, download, deletion is possible but not any FTP command can be
mapped to MogileFS command (eg. chmod).

The original nanoftpd version has been modified to be multi process capable
and some unmaintained code has been removed.

This is production safe quality software and we used it several month while
migrating to MogileFS.
