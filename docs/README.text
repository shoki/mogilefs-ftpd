README.text -- Textfile-based user authentication
-------------------------------------------------

you don't need a database anymore for storing user data! a plain text file
will do it as well...

structure:
---
username1:password1:uid1:gid1
username2:password2:uid2:gid2
...
usernamen:passwordn:uidn:gidn
---

exapmple:
---
phanatic:password:1000:1000
anonymous:anonymous:0:0
---

config.php editing:
 - $CFG->dbtype = "text" -- this is needed to use a textfile as database...
 - $CFG->text['file'] = "path/to/userdata.txt" -- sets the file where your user's datas are...
 - $CFG->text['sep'] = ":" -- you can leave it...

note: the file must be readable for the user running nanoFTPd
